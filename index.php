        The missile knows where it is at all times. It knows this because it knows where it isn't. By subtracting
        where it is from where it isn't, or where it isn't from where it is - whichever is greater - it obtains a
        difference or deviation. The guidance subsystem uses deviations to generate corrective commands to drive the
        missile from a position where it is to a position where it isn't, and arriving at a position that it wasn't,
        it now is. Consequently, the position where it is is now the position that it wasn't, and if follows that
        the position that it was is now the position that it isn't. In the event that the position that it is in is
        not the position that it wasn't, the system has acquired a variation. The variation being the difference
        between where the missile is and where it wasn't. If variation is considered to be a significant factor, it
        too may be corrected by the GEA. However, the missile must also know where it was. The missile guidance
        computer scenario works as follows: Because a variation has modified some of the information that the
        missile has obtained, it is not sure just where it is. However, it is sure where it isn't, within reason,
        and it know where it was. It now subtracts where it should be from where it wasn't, or vice versa. And by
        differentiating this from the algebraic sum of where it shouldn't be and where it was, it is able to obtain
        the deviation and its variation, which is called error.

        Light Yagami was born on February 28, 1986 (or 1989 in the anime). He is portrayed as a teen genius and
        a model student with a polite, reserved, and gentleman-like personality, who is well-liked and popular among
        his peers and teachers and known for being the class topper.[11][12] At the beginning of the story, Light is
        a student in his last year of high school; he later attends To-Oh University (東応大学, Tōō Daigaku). His
        father,
        Soichiro Yagami, is the chief of the National Police Agency, and is the head of the task force hunting for
        "Kira"
        , the name the public has given to the perpetrator of a string of inexplicable murders around the world. His
        mother, Sachiko, is a housewife. His younger sister, Sayu, acts as a cheerful, less academic foil of Light
        himself.

        In the deep blue abyss of the sea, where the sun's rays dare not penetrate, there lies an Eldritch Horror, a
        nightmare
        born of ancient terrors. Its colossal form defies comprehension, a grotesque amalgamation of tentacles and
        eyes, oozing
        iridescent phosphorescence that paints the surrounding waters with an eerie glow. Unfathomable and alien, it
        drifts through
        the depths like a spectral specter, whispering madness into the minds of those who dare to glimpse its
        hideous visage, a
        living enigma from a realm beyond human understanding.
